# Facebook Only Hosts File

Just a private hosts file

I use WhatsApp, and don't have an Instagram account but often read news articles with instagram posts embedded. 

So, other Facebook blacklists often include everything Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. 

I just wanted to block the main Facebook site and it's tracking services.

This blacklist is an attempt at solving this issue for myself, and anyone else who would like to use it.
